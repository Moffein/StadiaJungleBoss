## StadiaJungleBoss

Replaces the Legendary Chest on Sundered Grove with a Mending Magma Worm bossfight.

The worm does NOT get elite stat bonuses (unless playing with Honor), but DOES get the ScriptedCombatEncounter bonus that the other stage 4 bosses get.

To activate the bossfight, find and hit all 5 buttons on the map. Rewards will drop around a mushroom in the back-right corner of the map (assuming you're facing from the cliff to the big tree).

## For Developers

Feel free to use code from this mod if you ever make a unique boss for this stage. Just swap out the spawncard with your own, and set the spawnposition in ScriptedCombatEncounter.cs
